# robotic_arm_ws
ROS Workspace for 7 dof robotic arm with Fusion-360 model, Fritzing file, electronic circuits and schematics.
I assume the Software task is aimed at testing the ROS specific skiils and therefore I am using the robotic arm from the Hardware task for simulation in Gazebo. Motion planning is done using MoveIt and it will be controlled either by a keyboard or joystick.
